# list of languages spoken and written by country
#
# Ordered by:
#
# 1. Statewide official (used by government) language(s)
#
# 2. Written trade languages / lingua franca(s) if the official language(s) do not do the job.
#    This is often the case in Africa where the official language is e.g. French but the majority
#    of the (rural) population doesn't speak it.
#
# 3. Written national majority languages in mother tongue by importance,
#    such as Catalan, Galician, Asturian etc. in Spain.
#
# 4. languages written by a clear minority are only included if it spoken by the majority in their
#    region and enjoys some official recognition (i.e. language used on signs) there
#
# Sources:
# - a good source (which doesn't make a distinction between spoken natively and spoken in general
#   though which this list tries to make, so additional research is necessary) is
#   http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html
